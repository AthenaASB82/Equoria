PART 3: Add to Your Game Plan File
You’re brilliant for keeping that file. I suggest adding the following topics as future tasks:

📌 Game Plan Items to Revisit Later
Frontend CI/CD (add workflows for frontend once it exists)

Deployment options: Vercel, Render, Netlify (for frontend/backend separately)

Environment secrets in GitHub (storing sensitive production credentials securely)

Docker containerization (for multi-service deployment or local sim of production)

GitHub Pages (docs) — in case you want to generate public documentation

ESLint and Prettier integration with VS Code — optional, for local developer experience

Pre-commit hook with Husky (run formatter/linter before commits)

✅ Write these as “Not urgent now — revisit when nearing release stage.”
