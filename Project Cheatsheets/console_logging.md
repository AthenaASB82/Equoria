Later (Pre-Production): Switch to Warning on Non-log Calls
When youâ€™re closer to launch or opening the codebase to collaborators, change it to:

json
Copy
Edit
"no-console": ["warn", { "allow": ["log"] }]
Why:
It still lets you use console.log() for basic status messages.

But it warns you about leaving console.warn() or console.error() in production code.

Helps maintain clean output and better logging practices.

ðŸš€ Final Production Setting (Optional)
In production, you can go back to:

json
Copy
Edit
"no-console": "error"
â€¦but only after youâ€™ve swapped to structured logging (e.g., Winston, Pino) or removed all debug logs.

ðŸ”§ For You Right Now:
json
Copy
Edit
"no-console": "off"
Use this to stay focused and friction-free while building and debugging.

Would you like me to generate a .eslintrc.json example with that included?
