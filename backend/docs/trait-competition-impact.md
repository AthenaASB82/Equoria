# Trait Impact on Competitions

## Overview

The Trait Competition Impact System enhances the existing competition scoring algorithm by factoring in epigenetic traits. This system provides balanced bonuses and penalties based on trait-discipline compatibility while ensuring core performance metrics remain the primary determinant of success.

## Key Features

- **Discipline-Specific Effects**: Traits have specialized impacts for certain disciplines
- **Balanced Modifiers**: Trait effects are carefully balanced to enhance but not dominate base stats
- **Diminishing Returns**: Multiple traits have reduced effectiveness to prevent overpowering
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 9 positive traits and 5 negative traits with detailed effects
- **Real-time Analysis**: API endpoints for trait impact analysis and comparison

## Competition Scoring Integration

### Updated Scoring Formula

```
finalScore = baseStatScore                  // 50/30/20 weighted stats
           + legacyTraitBonus              // +5 if horse trait matches discipline (legacy)
           + trainingScore                 // 0–100 training points
           + tackBonuses                   // saddle + bridle bonuses
           + riderModifiers               // % boost and reduction from rider
           + healthModifier               // % adjustment based on health
           + traitImpactModifier          // NEW: % adjustment based on epigenetic traits
           + randomLuckModifier           // ±1–10% random factor
```

### Trait Impact Calculation Process

1. **Trait Identification**: Extract visible traits from `epigenetic_modifiers.positive` and `epigenetic_modifiers.negative`
2. **Effect Lookup**: Check for discipline-specific effects, fall back to general effects
3. **Modifier Application**: Apply trait-specific score modifiers
4. **Diminishing Returns**: Reduce effectiveness for horses with many traits
5. **Score Adjustment**: Calculate final point adjustment based on base score

### Negative Traits

| Trait          | General Effect | Worst Disciplines                                     | Specialized Effect           |

## Balance and Fairness

### Modifier Limits

- **General Effects**: Maximum ±8% (Legendary Bloodline exception)
- **Specialized Effects**: Maximum ±12% for legendary traits, ±8% for others
- **Total Impact**: Capped at reasonable levels through diminishing returns

### Diminishing Returns Formula

```javascript
function calculateDiminishingReturns(traitCount) {
  if (traitCount <= 1) return 1.0; // 100% effectiveness
  if (traitCount === 2) return 0.95; // 95% effectiveness
  if (traitCount === 3) return 0.9; // 90% effectiveness
  if (traitCount === 4) return 0.85; // 85% effectiveness
  if (traitCount >= 5) return 0.8; // 80% effectiveness
}
```

### Design Principles

1. **Enhancement, Not Dominance**: Traits enhance performance but don't override base stats
2. **Meaningful Choices**: Different traits excel in different disciplines
3. **Balanced Risk/Reward**: Negative traits provide meaningful penalties
4. **Specialization Rewards**: Discipline-specific effects encourage strategic breeding
