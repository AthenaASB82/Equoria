}
```

### **Error Cases to Test**

#### **1. Invalid Authentication**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/competition/eligibility/1/Racing
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized
```

#### **2. Invalid Horse Ownership**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/competition/eligibility/999/Racing \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
# Expected: 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found
```

#### **3. Invalid Discipline**
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/competition/eligibility/1/InvalidDiscipline \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
# Expected: 400 Bad Request with available disciplines
```

#### **4. Duplicate Entry**
```bash
# Enter horse twice in same show
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/competition/enter \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"horseId": 1, "showId": 1}'
# Expected: 400 Bad Request - "Horse is already entered in this competition"
```

#### **5. Non-host Execution**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/competition/execute \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer NON_HOST_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"showId": 1}'
# Expected: 403 Forbidden - "Only the show host can execute this competition"
```

### **Validation Tests**

#### **1. Invalid Input Validation**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/competition/enter \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"horseId": "invalid", "showId": 1}'
# Expected: 400 Bad Request with validation errors
```

#### **2. Missing Required Fields**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/competition/enter \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"horseId": 1}'
# Expected: 400 Bad Request - missing showId
```

### **Success Criteria**

âœ… All endpoints return proper HTTP status codes
âœ… Authentication and authorization work correctly
âœ… Validation errors are properly handled and returned
âœ… Competition business logic is properly integrated
âœ… Hidden scoring is implemented (no raw scores in responses)
âœ… Leaderboard filtering works correctly
âœ… Error messages are clear and helpful
âœ… All endpoints are properly documented with Swagger

### **Notes**

- Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with actual JWT token from authentication
- Replace `HOST_TOKEN` with token from show host user
- Replace horse/show IDs with actual database IDs
- Ensure test data exists before running tests
- Check database state after operations to verify data persistence

## ðŸŽ¯ **TESTING COMPLETE**

If all tests pass, the Competition API endpoints are ready for production use!
