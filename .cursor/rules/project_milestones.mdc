### [2024-05-22] — Initial Backend Server Setup and Core Tooling Configured
- Implemented basic Express.js server structure with `app.js` for application logic and `server.js` for server instantiation.
- Centralized environment variable management in `config/config.js` with validation.
- Established a modular routing system with an example `/ping` route, controller, and validation middleware (`express-validator`).
- Integrated a global error handler middleware.
- Set up essential development tools: ESLint for linting, Prettier for formatting, Jest for testing (unit and integration), and Nodemon for auto-restarting the dev server.
- Configured Jest to use a separate test environment (`.env.test`) and `supertest` for API endpoint testing.
- Separated database connection logic into `db/index.js`, initialized by `server.js`.
- Decision: Adopted a structured approach to backend development, prioritizing modularity, testability, and best practices from the outset.

### [2024-12-28] — HorseSeed.js Critical Issues Resolved and Test Coverage Added
- **Fixed Critical ES Module Issues:** Resolved `__dirname` undefined error by implementing proper ES module file path handling with `fileURLToPath` and `import.meta.url`.
- **Added Missing Required Fields:** Added missing `age` fields to all sample horse data (ages 4, 5, and 1 respectively) to satisfy horseModel validation requirements.
- **Improved Data Processing Logic:** Replaced complex data transformation with direct field mapping and integrated with `horseModel.createHorse()` function for consistent validation.
- **Enhanced Error Handling:** Added null breed checks, graceful error handling, and comprehensive logging throughout the seeding process.
- **Implemented Comprehensive Testing:** Created `horseSeed.test.js` with 5 test cases covering findOrCreateBreed and ensureReferencedRecordsExist functions with proper ES module mocking.
- **Code Quality Improvements:** Exported utility functions for testability, removed redundant date processing, and streamlined the overall seeding workflow.
- **Integration Success:** All 20 tests now pass (15 horseModel + 5 horseSeed), ensuring end-to-end functionality from database seeding through model operations.
- **Technical Decision:** Chose to use horseModel.createHorse() in seed script rather than direct Prisma calls to maintain consistency and leverage existing validation logic.
- **Key Learning:** ES module imports require careful handling of file paths and module execution order when testing, leading to improved testing patterns for future modules.

### [2024-12-28] — Comprehensive Code Review and Production-Ready Improvements

  - Duplicate prevention: Horses cannot enter the same show multiple times
  - Discipline independence: Any horse can enter any discipline regardless of trait or specialization
- **Comprehensive Utility Function:** Created `backend/utils/isHorseEligible.js` with production-ready validation:
  - Input parameter validation with descriptive error messages
  - Flexible level limit handling (shows can have no limits, only min, only max, or both)
  - Mixed data type support for show IDs (string and numeric)
  - Proper handling of edge cases and boundary conditions
- **Extensive Test Coverage:** Implemented comprehensive test suite with 43 test cases covering:
  - Input validation scenarios (null/undefined parameters, invalid types)
  - Age requirement testing (boundary conditions, invalid ages)
  - Level requirement validation (min/max limits, flexible restrictions)

- **Business Rule Clarification:** Established clear eligibility rules that prioritize accessibility:
  - Health status affects scoring but NOT eligibility (horses can compete regardless of health)
  - Trait specialization affects performance but NOT eligibility (any horse can enter any discipline)
  - Age and level are the primary gatekeeping mechanisms for fair competition
- **Integration Success:** All 132 tests passing (89 existing + 43 new horse eligibility tests), maintaining system stability.
- **Production-Ready Features:** Implemented robust error handling, comprehensive validation, and flexible configuration support.
- **Technical Achievement:** Created reusable utility function suitable for show registration systems, UI eligibility checks, and competition management.
