### [2024-05-22] — Initial Backend Server Setup and Core Tooling Configured

### [Date TBD] — Breeds API and Horse Model Implementation
- Implemented API endpoints for `breeds` (POST, GET all, GET by ID) following TDD.
- Created `backend/routes/breedRoutes.js` and `backend/controllers/breedController.js`.
- Added input validation using `express-validator` and a shared `validationErrorHandler.js` middleware.
- Developed integration tests for the breeds API in `tests/integration/breeds.test.js`.
- Created `backend/models/horseModel.js` with `createHorse` and `getHorseById` functions for database interaction with the `public.horses` table based on the finalized schema.
- Updated `schema.sql` to include `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ... CASCADE` statements for easier table recreation.
- Decision: Continued with a modular, test-driven approach for API development.
